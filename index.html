      <div>
        <time>January 2015</time> It all started over a happy hour, two words one would often find in my repertoire. 
        <br><br>
 I was catching up with a former coworker; also a close friend and someone who loved food and happy hour as much as I did. Hana Aardal and I loved visiting new restaurants around town and spent many hours catching up on life, hilarious stories, and work. One night as we were catching up out of the blue, she suggested she wanted to set me up with her boyfriend's (Lance) brother, Tyler. I have never been big on being "set up" but from there the seed was planted.

      <div>
        <time>March 2015</time> I remember the first time I saw Tyler, it was at Lance’s 26th birthday. I didn’t know a single soul at this party except for my sweet friend Mary who decided to come with me, Lance, and Hana. Being a social person, we all had a great time dancing and celebrating the night.  A few hours passed and there we were standing back to back at the bar, Hana tapped Tyler on the shoulder and introduced us. After talking for a bit, we exchanged numbers and agreed to have lunch two days later. We started to date shortly after.

        <time>April 2015</time> Wanderlust is a real thing. 
        <br><br>Tyler and I decided to go on a trip to Hawaii together. You quickly learn a lot about someone while traveling. Staying in close quarters, observing one anothers habits, and experiencing new adventures. There were a lot of honest moments during this trip and I really appreciated that. This was a good testament that Tyler could hang with my sporadic “get up and go” personality.  Although I couldn’t get him to skydive with me… (we sat on the tarmac together for two hours...watching people fall from the sky. I could feel his nerves, so instead of jumping out of a plane that day, we ate shrimp together on the North Shore) I knew from that day forward Tyler was going to play an integral part in my life.

        <time>May 2015 - July 2016</time>From there, life was a whirlwind. Between traveling all over the world (and of course the many trips to Vegas), becoming yoga certified, switching jobs/industry, and building strong relationships with both of our families and friends, Tyler has become my best friend. There is never a dull day in our household.

        <time>August 2016</time> Tyler planned a trip to Banff, Calgary, a new location/area to both of us. Once we arrived, driving through the majestic Rockies- (trust me, they're really majestic) we arrived into the town. We were surrounded by blue green milky water, beautiful tall trees, and mountains cut by glaciers. It is truly one of the most beautiful places in the world.
